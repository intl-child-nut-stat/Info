## Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?

There are a lot of child malnutrition nonprofits around the globe. Itâ€™s difficult to keep track of all the data for thousands of kids that are screened. This apps allows their data to be entered and saved, and tracked over time. It keeps records organized by both country name and community name.

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

Our app will allow registered admins to 1. add data for child screenings and 2. view contact info, past screenings, children in need, etc. for each community and country. 

- What is the mission statement?

 

## Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?

1. Onboarding for new admin users
2. Onboarding for country specific users
3. Add child screening records to a country's page
4. Pages that display all countries, all communities within a country, and all children within a community. 

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?

1. Ability to download an excel sheet for a screening date, child, community, etc. 

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?

There does not seem to be a common app that does this. UNICEF and WHO have very detailed tracking of malnutrition, iodine deficiency, low birthweights, among many other data points that are country specific, but child specific data is harder to find. There is no shortage of documentation of the prevalence of child malnutrition and the harm it causes across the world. 

## Frameworks/Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?

BE:
FE: React, Redux, Redux-Thunk, Styled Components, amCharts 4
UI:

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?

No

- Are you required to pay to use the API?

No

- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)

No


## Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.

Nonprofit organizations such as UNICEF and WHO could use the app in order to keep track of the malnutrition on a more detailed community level and redirect resources to areas that need screening/food assistance. 

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

No potential users have been contacted. 

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

No we have not.
